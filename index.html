    <h1>Stages of Fetal Development</h1>
    <h2>By, Marco Heinrichs</h2>

      <p>Month 1: In the first month of fetal development, the Amniotic Sac will envelope the embryo and continue to house and prtotect the fetus throught the rest of its development. During the first month all of the fetus's organs will develope from the two layers of cells that make the embryo. A primitive placenta is slowly tunneling its way into the womans uturine lining, creating space for blood and nutrients to flow to the fetus. The yolk sac produces the fetus's red blood cells and gives nutrients until the placenta is ready to take over the roll of nuturing the fetus. At the fold of the top layer of the embryo is the neural tube. This tube will develop into the baby's brain, spinal cord, nerves, and backbone. The amniotic sac has now encased the embyo, which floats in amniotic fluid, the amount of fluid will increase overtime. The fetus is beginning to develope its arm and leg buds, its lower jaw is forming and so are vocal cords and a tongue. The fetus's heart is forming and beating twice as fast as the mothers heart as it divides into right and left chambers. The Umbilical cord has formed.</p>

      <p>Month 2: The nerve cells in the fetus's brain are branching out to connect with one another, forming primitive neural pathways. The hands and knees of the fetus are more developed, the fingers are still webbed but are growing longer. The eyelids of the fetus are fused shut and wont open for another 4 months. The fetus is now able to move its major joints: shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles. The forehead of the fetus is very large as its brain sits high on the head. The fingers have sperated and are now growing little nails. The yolk sac is disapearing as it is now longer needed. The fetus is now able to open and close its fists. Skin is still transparent alowing blood vessels to been seen. Tiny tooth buds are developing under the gums of the fetus. The ears are moving into the proper positions, the eyes have moved closer together. The fetus's intestines, (have grown so rapidly that they protrude into the umbilical cord) will start to move back into her abdominal cavity now.</p>

      <p>Month 3: The fetus's urinary tract is now functioning; it's starting to urinate out the amniotic fluid he's been swallowing. The fetus's head is now more proportional; it's about a third the size of his body. The arms of the fetus are lengthening, soon they will be in proportion with the rest of the body. Thanks to brain impulses, the fetus's facial muscles are getting a workout as it squints, frowns, and grimaces. The fetus is starting to develop an ultra-fine downy covering of hair all over her body; this hair is called lanugo. The fetus is inhaling and exhaling the amniotic fluid, which will help the air sacs in the lungs develop. Even though the eyelids of the fetus are fused shut, it can still detect light. The legs of the featus are growing to be longer than the arms. The fetus is now able to move all of its limbs and joints. The heart of the fetus is now pumping about 25 quarts of blood a day. The head of the fetus is more poised now, the scalp pattern is now developing although the hair is not growing in yet. Toenails are now starting to grow in.</p>

      <p>Month 4: The skeleton of the fetus is slowly turning from rubbery cartilage to hardened bone. The umbilical cord of the fetus in now growing stronger and thicker. The blood vessels of the fetus are visible through the skin, and the ears are moving into place and stand out from the head. The fetus is flexing its arms and legs frequently, these movements are becoming more noticable to the mother. This is a crucial time for sensory development. The fetus's brain is designating specialized areas for smell, taste, hearing, vision, and touch. Hair is beginning to sprout from the fetus's scalp. Meconium is accumulating in your baby's bowel. This sticky black substance made up of sloughed cells, digestive secretions, and swallowed amniotic fluid will be the first feces that the infant will excrete. The fetus's body is now coated with a oily white substance, the vernix caseosa, that protects the skin during its long submersion in amniotic fluid.</p>

      <p>Month 5: The fetus's eyelids and eyebrows are now fully developed. The mother may develop varicose veins in her legs, in part because her growing uterus puts pressure on the inferior vena cava, the large vein that returns blood from the legs to the heart.Eyes: Your baby's eyelids are still fused shut. Beneath them, the eyes are developed but the irises (the colored part of the eye) still lack pigment. The fetus's lips are becoming more distinct and tooth buds are developing beneath its gum line. Its skin will look wrinkled until she gains enough weight to fill it out. Loud noises that the fetus hears often in utero such as the dog barking probably won't bother him or her after birth. The fetus's skin is red and wrinkled. This is true for all fetu's, regardless of what color their skin will be after birth. The taste buds of the fetus are now developing, and the fetus's lungs are developing "branches" of the respiratory system as well as cells that will produce surfactant, a substance that helps the Alveoli in the lungs inflate easily.</p>

      <p>Month 6: The fetus is starting to put on fat. As it does, the skin will start to fill out and it'll start to look more like a newborn. The fetus's hair now has recognizable color and texture, although these details may change after it's born. The nerve pathways in the fetus's ears are developing, so response to sounds will grow more consistent with time. The fetus now can open and close the eyes and will sleep at regular intervals while still inside the uterus. The fetus has developed eyelashes as well and will look for an outside light source. The skeleton of the fetus is recieving about 200 milligrams of calcium a day in order to develope and harden. The skull is also growing in size to accommodate its growing brain which is developing billions of nerons.</p>

      <p>Month 7: The fetus is able to distinguish between light and dark. At birth, its vision will be about 20/400, which means it can only make out objects a few inches from its face. Some fetus' have a full head of hair by this point and others will still only have peach fuzz. The skull of the fetus has not yet fused together this helps the fetus ease throught the cervix of the mother.</p>

      <p>Month 8: The lungs of the fetus are well developed. The chances of the fetus having a long term problem with the lungs are very slim. The fetus is gaining about an ounce a day as it prepares for the world outside the uterus. The fetus is now head down as it prepares for birth, the skull may settle in deeper into the mothers pelvis. The fetus is shedding most of the downy body hair as well as some of the vernix caseosa, the oily substance that protects the skin from the amniotic fluid.</p>

      <p>Month 9: The eye pigment of the fetus is not yet determined, however if it has brown eyes at birth chances are they will stay brown, If it's born with dark gray or blue eyes, they may stay that color or turn brown, green, or hazel during the first year after birth. The fetus also has a frim grasp. The outer skin cells of the fetus are sloughing off as new skin forms underneath. The hair and nails of the fetus continue to grow with each passing day, and even after birth the child will have soft spots on its head becuase the skull has not yet fully fused, it may take a year or more for the skull to completely fuse together.</p>
